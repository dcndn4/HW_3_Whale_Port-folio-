# HW_3_Whale_Port-folio-
Portfolio Analysis w Pandas homework 3, unit 4

Github suggested a add this when I moved the existing original readme over to resources. So here is this!

This repo is the storage collection related to the 3rd homework assignment. It will house the versions leading up to submittal, as well as some post-submittal work as my learning process continues. 

And then related resources. 

And thanks for all the fish!
